Introduction
The "Goblin Slayer" RPG is a command-line based game where players take on the role of a hero battling goblins to save the world. The game features a character creation system, diverse character classes, a turn-based battle system, and options for saving and loading progress.

Getting Started
To start the game, run the main executable. You will be presented with three options: New Game, Load Game, or Exit. Choose New Game to create a new character, Load Game to continue a previous session, or Exit to exit the game.

New Game
When selecting New Game, you will be prompted to enter your character's name and choose a job from the available options: Knight, Wizard, Barbarian, Rogue, or the secret job, DemonKing (accessible by pressing 5 when creating a character).

After character creation, your character's information, including name, job, level, experience, attack, defense, and health, will be displayed.

Load Game
Choose Load Game to load a previously saved character from the "character.txt" file.

Character Classes
The game offers five character classes, each with unique stats and abilities:

Knight: A skilled warrior with high defense.
Wizard: A magical character with powerful spells.
Barbarian: A fierce and strong character with high attack.
Rogue: A stealthy character with enhanced agility.
DemonKing: A secret and powerful class with unique abilities.
Character classes determine the skills, damage, attack, defense, and health of your hero.

Battle System
Engage in turn-based battles against goblins. Choose between attacking or fleeing. If you flee, a new goblin with random stats will be generated. If you choose to battle, use your character's unique skills to defeat the goblin. The game also allows the use of potions to restore health.

After each battle, gain experience points. Upon reaching 100 experience points, your character will level up, gaining additional stats.

Save and Load
Save your progress by choosing Save & Exit at the end of the game. The character's information will be stored in the "character.txt" file. Load your saved game using the Load Game option at the main menu.

Rest and Continue
Choose Rest & Continue to fully restore your character's health and continue the adventure. This option is available at the end of each battle.
